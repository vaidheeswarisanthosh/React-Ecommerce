<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->


This project is a simple e-commerce web application that uses the Fake Store API to fetch product data and allows users to manage their shopping cart. 

Features:
1.Add to Cart: Users can add products to the cart with a single click. If a product is already in the cart, an alert is displayed.

2.View Cart: The number of items in the cart is displayed in the Navbar, and a modal shows the detailed cart view with all added products.

3.Remove from Cart: Users can remove items from the cart using the "Remove" button in the modal.

4.Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.

Technologies Used:

React.js: Component-based architecture and state management.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive styling.

JavaScript (ES6): Core language for building functionality.
